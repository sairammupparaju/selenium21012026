Phases of SDLC:-
There are six phases in SDLC. They are
1)Requirments gathering
2)Designing
3)Implementation(Development)
4)Testing
5)Deployment
6)Maintenance


1) Requirements Gathering

In this phase, the needs and expectations of stakeholders are collected and analyzed.
The goal is to clearly understand what the software should do.

2) Designing

Based on the requirements, the system architecture and design are created. This includes high-level design (HLD) and
low-level design (LLD), defining system components, data flow, and interfaces.

3) Implementation (Development)

The actual coding of the software takes place in this phase. Developers write code using suitable programming languages and 
frameworks based on the design documents.

4) Testing

The developed software is tested to identify and fix bugs or defects. This ensures the software works as expected and 
meets the specified requirements.There are different types of testings available they are unit testing, integration testing,
system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

5) Deployment

After successful testing, the software is released into the production environment where end users can access and use it.

6) Maintenance

This phase involves ongoing support after deployment. It includes fixing issues, improving performance, and adding enhancements 
based on user feedback.
